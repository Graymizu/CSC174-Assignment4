					Rochester International Choreography Entertainment Crew, a 	committee of KASA, promotes the cultural aspects of Korean pop dance (Kpop) and music while integrating it with its American hip hop counterparts. We hope to promote the similarities and link between the two genres. RICE Crew performs in KASA and other campus organizations' events as an illustration of Korean pop dance and music. Anyone who is interested in learning Korean and American hip hop dances are welcomed regardless of ethnicity.

					Hello! My name is Lulu and I am a third year at the University of Rochester. Currently, I am working on a independent study at the Saunders Research Building located at the hospital. I have experience as a field worker with people of disabilities. I am pursuing a minor in Computer Science because it will be beneficial for my future. I used to be a Graphic Design Major and still love to play around with code and formatting during my free time.

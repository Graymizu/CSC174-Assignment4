				About Me
			</h2>

				<p>
					Hello! My name is shareef and I am a senior year at the University of Rochester. Currently, I am working on a independent study at the Saunders Research Building located at the hospital. I have experience as a field worker with people of disabilities. I am pursuing a minor in Computer Science because it will be beneficial for my future. I used to be a Graphic Design Major and still love to play around with code and formatting during my free time.

			<h3>
				My Role
			</h3>
				<p>
					As a academic coach I audit a course with a student in TOUR and we take a college course together. I also meet with them outside of class time for a hour or so every week to help them keep up in the class. As a coach, my primary job is to help my mentee reach the goal that they want for the particular class they are taking.

				Graphic Design 
			</h2>

				<p>
					I transferred to the University of Rochester in the year of 2014. However, during my time at my other college, I took a couple of Graphic Design courses and fell in love with it. We did not code much, but we played around with formatting and 3D design.
